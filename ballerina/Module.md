## Overview

This module provides APIs for searching, splitting, and replacing the set of characters of a string. These APIs are using a 
regular expression as a `String` to perform these operations by finding the string matches.

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), are notations for describing sets of 
character strings. If a particular string is in the set described by a regular expression, the regular expression matches that string.

For information on the operations, which you can perform with the regex module, see the below **Functions**.
